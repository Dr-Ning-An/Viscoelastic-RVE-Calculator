This code was originally developed to implement a multiscale modeling strategy into Abaqus to compute the viscoelastic behavior of unidirectional composite laminates and deployable structures. The "Viscoelastic_RVE_Calculator.zip" contains all source codes and two numerical examples of the plug-in.
